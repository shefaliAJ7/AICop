# AICop

Our Prototype in Phase 2 is a simulation of how our entire AICop system will behave in different scenarios.

This Prototype is a Java Swing Application, created using Java as the programming language and Java Swing as the framework. It explains different use cases more graphically, which will be easy to understand for the stakeholders.They will be able to understand how the AICop will work behind the scenes in determining Traffic Violation using sensors and camera and also how Violation Tickets will be issued to the defaulters.
We took a video of the prototype and here is the link (https://youtu.be/LpzGOL_arHs).

1. We have SRS_AICop.jar which is a deployable Jar File and can be run in any OS, without the need of any external Software Download.
To run this, just double click on SRS_AICop.jar

2. To run the source code: <br>
  a. Open any IDE which supports Java Programming language (Eclipse, Neatbeans or Intellij). <br>
  b. Import this project as JAVA project. <br>
  c. Go to SRS_AICop\src\srs_aicop\SRS_AICop.java and do 'Run as Java Application'. <br>

Instructions to run the Application:
1. After running the application by Step 1 or 2, a Window opens.
2. On the left side of the Window Frame, click on 'Red', 'Green' or 'Yellow' radio button, which represents Traffic light.
3. Click on 'Car Stopped' or 'Car moved with speed:' radio button.
4. If you click on 'Car moved with speed:', mention speed on the Textbox next to 'Car moved with speed:' radio button.
5. Click on 'Check Violation' Button.
6. Steps 1-5 helps in giving different Input Scenarios.
7. You will see the output results, after 4-5 seconds of wait-time.
8. Please refer (https://youtu.be/LpzGOL_arHs) or the Video submitted. The video explains how to give input scenarios and what output could be expected respectively.
9. You can click on 'Clear' button to reset the Input Scenario.
