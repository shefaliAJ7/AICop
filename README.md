# AICop

Our Prototype in Phase 2 is a simulation of how our entire AICop system will behave in different scenarios.

This Prototype is a Java Swing Application, created using Java as the programming language and Java Swing as the framework. It explains different use cases more graphically, which will be easy to understand for the stakeholders.They will be able to understand how the AICop will work behind the scenes in determining Traffic Violation using sensors and camera and also how Violation Tickets will be issued to the defaulters.
We took a video of the prototype and here is the link (https://youtu.be/LpzGOL_arHs).
